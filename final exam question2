The time complexity of the insert() method in the minimum priority queue implementation I provided is O(log n).

The insert() method first appends the new element to the end of the linked list, which takes O(1) time on average. Then it performs a bubbling up operation that goes up the tree from the newly added leaf node to the root. The maximum number of levels in a complete binary tree is log n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Since each level is traversed once, the total time complexity of the bubbling up operation is O(log n).

The time complexity of the delMin() method in the minimum priority queue implementation I provided is also O(log n).

The delMin() method first remove the root element from the linked list (i.e, minimum element), and then moves the last leaf element to the root position to maintain the complete binary tree property. Then it performs a bubbling down operation that goes down the tree from the root to the leaf nodes. The maximum number of levels in a complete binary tree is log n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Since each level is traversed once, the total time complexity of the bubbling down operation is O(log n).

In both cases, the time complexity is O(log n) because the insert() and delMin() methods traverse at most log n levels in the tree, where n is the number of elements in the priority queue. This is because the linked list we are using is a complete binary tree and because the linked list is a linear data structure, the append and deletion in linked list takes O(1) time on average.

As a simple performance benchmark, we can test the time complexity of the insert() and delMin() methods by timing the execution of 1000 insertion and deletions on the priority queue. The results can be visualized using a line graph, with time on the y-axis and operations on the x-axis.
